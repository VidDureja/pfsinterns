# Voice Assistant

This was probably the most fun project to build! I learned about speech recognition and how to make my computer listen to me.

## What I Learned

- **Speech Recognition**: How to make the computer understand what I'm saying
- **Text-to-Speech**: Making the computer talk back to me
- **API Integration**: Working with external services (weather API)
- **Multi-threading**: Running background tasks while listening for commands
- **Error Handling**: Dealing with microphone issues and network problems

## What It Does

It's like having a personal assistant that you can talk to! You can:
- Ask it to tell you the time and date
- Get weather information for any city
- Search the web by voice
- Set reminders (it will remind you later)
- Open applications on your computer
- Have a conversation with it

## How to Run It

1. Go to the voice_assistant folder:
   ```bash
   cd voice_assistant
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the assistant:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## What You Need

- **Microphone**: Your computer needs to hear you
- **Internet**: For speech recognition and weather data
- **Weather API Key** (optional): For weather features

## How to Use It

When you run it, it will say "Hello! I am your personal voice assistant. How can I help you today?"

Then you can try commands like:
- "What time is it?"
- "What's the weather in New York?"
- "Search for Python tutorials"
- "Set a reminder for buy groceries at 5 PM"
- "Open notepad"
- "Exit" (to quit)

## Challenges I Faced

- **Microphone setup** was tricky - had to figure out which microphone to use
- **Speech recognition accuracy** - sometimes it doesn't understand me
- **API keys** - had to learn how to get and use them
- **Background processing** - making reminders work in the background

## Cool Features

- **Background reminder checking**: It remembers your reminders even when you're not talking to it
- **Weather integration**: Gets real-time weather data
- **Web search**: Opens your browser and searches for you
- **Application control**: Can open programs on your computer

## What I'm Proud Of

- It actually understands what I'm saying most of the time!
- The reminder system works in the background
- I figured out how to handle different types of voice commands
- The weather feature is pretty cool

This project taught me that voice technology is really powerful and fun to work with. It's amazing how you can control your computer just by talking to it!
