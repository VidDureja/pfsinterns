# My Python Internship Projects

Hey! This is my repository for the Python Developer Internship at Pinnacle Full-Stack Interns. I built three different projects to learn different aspects of Python development.

## What I Built

I created three projects, each focusing on different skills:

1. **Hotel Management System** - My first desktop app with a database
2. **Voice Assistant** - Learned speech recognition and automation
3. **Task Management System** - Built my first web application

## Project Structure

```
pfsinterns/
├── hotel_management/     # Desktop app with GUI
├── voice_assistant/      # Speech recognition app
├── task_management/      # Web app with Flask
└── README.md            # This file
```

## Hotel Management System

This was my first time building a desktop application! I learned how to:
- Create a GUI using Tkinter (which was harder than I expected)
- Work with SQLite databases (my first time using SQL)
- Handle user input and validation
- Organize code using classes

### What it does:
- Add hotel reservations with guest info
- View all current reservations
- Edit or delete reservations
- Search for specific guests
- Track room availability

### How to run it:
```bash
cd hotel_management
python3 main.py
```

**Note**: On Mac, you might need to install Tkinter first: `brew install python-tk`

## Voice Assistant

This was the most fun project! I learned about:
- Speech recognition (using Google's API)
- Text-to-speech conversion
- Working with external APIs
- Multi-threading for background tasks

### What it does:
- Listens to voice commands
- Tells you the weather (if you set up an API key)
- Searches the web for you
- Sets reminders
- Tells you the time and date
- Opens applications on your computer

### How to run it:
```bash
cd voice_assistant
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

**Note**: You'll need a microphone, and for weather features, you need to get a free API key from OpenWeatherMap.

## Task Management System

My first web application! This was challenging because I had to learn:
- Flask web framework
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- Database design with SQLAlchemy
- Web development concepts

### What it does:
- Create and manage tasks
- Set priorities and due dates
- Track task status
- Search and filter tasks
- View statistics dashboard

### How to run it:
```bash
cd task_management
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```
Then open http://localhost:5001 in your browser.

## What I Learned

This internship taught me so much! I went from knowing basic Python to building:
- Desktop applications with GUIs
- Speech recognition systems
- Web applications with databases

### Technical Skills:
- Python programming
- GUI development with Tkinter
- Web development with Flask
- Database management with SQLite
- API integration
- Project organization and documentation

### Biggest Challenges:
- Understanding how classes work (took me a while!)
- Setting up virtual environments
- Learning SQL and database concepts
- Making the web app look good with CSS

## Getting Started

Each project has its own folder with instructions. I recommend starting with the hotel management system since it's the most straightforward.

If you run into issues:
1. Make sure you have Python 3.7+ installed
2. Check the individual project READMEs for specific setup instructions
3. The setup guide has troubleshooting tips

## About This Internship

- **Program**: Python Developer Internship at Pinnacle Full-Stack Interns
- **Duration**: February 2025
- **Goal**: Learn Python development through hands-on projects

This was my first real programming internship, and I'm really proud of what I built! Each project taught me something different and helped me understand how real software development works.
